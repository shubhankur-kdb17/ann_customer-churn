# ann_customer-churn
Artificial Neural Network for Customer Churn Prediction
Overview:
This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. The model is trained on structured data containing customer demographics, account details, and transaction history to identify factors influencing churn.

Dataset:
Name: Churn_Modelling.csv
Source: Contains customer details such as credit score, geography, age, balance, and churn status.
Objective:
To develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify customers as likely to churn or stay using an ANN.

Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Implementation Steps:

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.

Building the ANN:
Input layer, hidden layers with activation functions, output layer.

Model Training & Evaluation:
Splitting data, compiling model, optimizing with backpropagation.

Performance Metrics:
Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision-recall analysis.

Predictions & Insights:
Identifying key features influencing customer churn.

Results & Insights:
The model achieved 86.25% accuracy on test data.
